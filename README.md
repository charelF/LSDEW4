VU LSDE 2021 - Assignment 2 - Project W4 - DDOS Detection

## Project Description

> Wikipedia publishes [hourly page view statistics](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/pageview_complete/readme.html) for their projects. This data is available in this shape from 2015 onwards. The popularity of topics in Wikipedia can give an indication of the interest of people over time and space (the latter, specifically in non-english language domains).

> **W4: DDOS Detection.** Find Distributed Denial Of Service (DDOS) attacks to Wikipedia. This should include devising criteria to distinguish DDOS attacks from trending topics. Summarize these attacks over time and cluster them by theme
